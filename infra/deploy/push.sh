# Ships this app to one host from a revision, and records which.

#   BEAMLINE=19-bm HOST=radon ./push.sh c7a5a55
#   BEAMLINE=7-bm  HOST=karman PREFIX=corasim7bm:TomoScan: ./push.sh v0.4.0
#   HOST=lyra ./push.sh HEAD
#
# Which app is read from where this script sits rather than written into
# it, so the same bytes serve every app that deploys into a home directory.
# A mirror carries its own copy, as it carries its own licence, and a test
# in the tree proves the copies identical.
#
# ## Why the beamline is optional and the host is not
#
# A host is what this ships to and there is always one. A beamline is what
# the thing being shipped belongs to, and not everything here belongs to
# one: a thinker is handed an execution and reads where that ran off the
# record, so it has no beamline setting to be told and asking for one
# would mean writing a fiction into the revision file.
#
# It is not merely defaulted, because the apps that do need it need it
# absolutely. Each of their installers requires it on its own, so pushing
# one without it stops at the install step with that installer's own
# message, after a copy that changed nothing a service reads.
#
# The revision is required rather than defaulting to HEAD. It defaulted
# once, and the day a commit landed that must not reach a beamline, the
# bare command silently became the dangerous one. Naming what you ship is
# the whole point of the script, so it asks.
#
# ## Why this exists rather than an rsync of src
#
# Deploying used to be `rsync -a --delete src/ host:...`, which reads the
# working tree. Whatever sits open in an editor at that moment is what
# reaches the beamline, and nothing between a keystroke and a running
# experiment refuses it. That is not hypothetical: this tree held an
# unfinished change to a client's filing seam for most of one day, and
# either deployed beamline would have taken it.
#
# `git archive` of a commit cannot do that. What lands is something that
# exists in history, so it can be named, compared between beamlines, and
# rolled back to.
#
# ## Why it writes a revision file
#
# A host that cannot say what it runs makes every later question
# unanswerable: whether a fix reached it, whether two beamlines match, what
# to go back to. Before this, the only way to ask was to grep the deployed
# source for a function name and infer.
#
# ## What it does not do
#
# It does not build the virtualenv, which `install.sh` does and only when
# one is missing, and it does not touch the configuration, which holds the
# beamline's token and belongs to whoever runs the keeper.
