# Conventions

*How this project is written: what a name has to do, what a docstring is for,
and what a commit message has to say.*

The chassis rules, and only the parts that bind a plain Python library. The
keeper carries the rest, because they are about bounded contexts, event
sourcing and a database this project does not have.

## R1: Read-aloud test

Say the name out loud. If it does not read like natural English, it is a smell, even when it parses correctly as code.

- "default parameters" reads naturally.
- "parameter defaults" stalls. It works as an adjectival construction, but not as a domain noun.

The trap is that code identifiers compose without grammar checks. `parameter_defaults: dict` typechecks fine. The compiler does not notice that English speakers will say "the default parameters". Identifiers that fight English become identifiers people misremember, mistype, and have to look up.

**Also count the term's domain overloads.** A term that reads naturally in isolation can have hidden collisions. At lock time, list the distinct meanings the word already carries in this domain. If there are more than three, look harder.

## R2: Symmetry across the family

When a related family of names exists (defaults / overrides / effective; declared / derived / cached), every member must share the same word-order skeleton.

Ask: if I list every member of this family, do they all share a skeleton? If not, fix it before locking.

**A family has a MEANING, not just a size.** Before adopting a family on a member-count argument, read two or three of its members and check that the family holds a meaning the new member shares. `to_X` returning something that is not an `X` joins the big family while breaking its semantics, which is worse than the outlier it replaced. Every cited fact can be true and the conclusion still wrong.

## R3: Family-noun primacy, with the role as an adjective prefix

**The family noun goes LAST. The role goes first, as an adjective.**

```
<role>_<family-noun-plural>

default_parameters     override_parameters     effective_parameters
default_settings       override_settings       effective_settings
```

This matches how English assembles compound nouns. The family noun carries the primary meaning; the adjective specializes it.

The counter-example to avoid is `<family>_<role>`, which puts the abstract family noun first and a role noun second, pretending to be a suffix. It is grammatical but awkward in use.

**This rule is read backwards more often than any other in this document.** R3 says noun-LAST. Before proposing a rename on R3 grounds, re-read this section.

The schema is the exception: a schema describes the family rather than specializing within it, so `parameters_schema` is family-noun plus descriptor. There is no role, because a schema is not a role within the family. It IS the family contract.

**Collective nouns are not plurals.** "Wiring" and "plumbing" read naturally in speech but break the field-name pattern. Use the plural for a collection field and reserve the collective for a higher-level concept label.

## R4: Lock-time read-aloud process

Before locking a design, run the R1 and R2 checks once more over every name in it. This is mechanical, takes about five minutes, and catches what mid-design momentum hides.

1. List every new name introduced: fields, classes, functions, error classes.
2. For each, say it aloud. Awkward? Flag it.
3. Group into families by shared role-words. Do the skeletons match? If not, flag.
4. Fix anything flagged and re-list.
5. Then lock.


## Where these rules do not apply

- **Single-instance fields** with no family. R2 has nothing to check. R1 still applies.
- **Industry-standard names** that follow a different convention. `created_at` and `occurred_at` are standard; do not rename them for symmetry with anything.
- **Names that landed before a rule existed.** Apply the rules to new work and let old work pass through normal evolution, unless a rename is independently motivated.


## Documentation

Docstrings carry intent. Comments carry hidden constraints. Test names carry scenarios. Everything else is noise.

### Which home a claim belongs in

There are two places a rule can be written down, and writing it in both is how
they drift. The split:

| | Owns | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/` | The RULE. What the convention is, why it exists in general, what the anti-patterns are. | "A port is a Protocol, and its adapters are named for the technology behind them." |
| A docstring | The SITE. Why THIS module implements the rule the way it does, and what is non-obvious here. | "This store is one instance per process, because more than one BC appends through it." |

A docstring that restates the general rule is duplication. Link instead: open by
naming the convention page, then explain only what this seam adds.

**A fact may appear in both; a rationale may not.** The idempotency cache key
is stated in `patterns.md` and again on the port, because a reader of the port
must see the contract without leaving the file. What must NOT appear twice is
the reason for it: two explanations of one decision become two decisions the
first time someone edits one.

When they do conflict, the page wins and the docstring is the bug.
It is the page a reader consults before writing code, so a stale rule there
misleads earlier and wider than a stale docstring does.

### Do not describe machinery that does not exist

Write a rule as a rule. Do not write it as a description of enforcement unless
the enforcement is there: "enforced by `test_x.py`" is a claim a reader will
check by reading the sentence, not the directory.

The chassis this project started from arrived with such claims in it,
naming fitness tests that exist in the project it was copied from and not
here. Each one was either deleted or made true before the copy was staged.
A rule known to be unenforced is useful. A rule falsely believed to be
enforced is worse than no rule, because nobody looks twice at it.

The same applies to evidence. A measurement belongs to the system that
measured it; quoting a sibling project's numbers to justify a decision here
makes the reasoning unfalsifiable, since nothing in this tree can reproduce
or refute them.

No emoji anywhere in source: comments, docstrings, log strings, error messages, `Field(description=...)`. Emoji in source is a documented LLM tell that accumulates as noise across reviews. This mirrors the no-em-dash rule applied to prose.

### Citing an external source

Two different things get called a citation, and they need different links.

**Reading a source: link the moving ref.** A navigational link wants whatever that page says today, so link `main`, `HEAD`, or `/en/latest/`. Pinning a navigational link sends the reader to a stale copy, which is worse than no link.

**Sourcing a value: identify the version.** When a number, an address, a serial, or a step order is recorded because an external artifact said so, the citation has to say which state of that artifact. Otherwise the value silently stops matching its own source the next time the source changes, and nothing here notices. Use a commit SHA for a repository, and for a page with no addressable version, keep the readable link and name the date the value was folded from it beside the value.

The distinction is not about how important the source is. It is about whether this project is repeating a claim. A record whose provenance means "whatever that file says now" is not a record.

Verify before pinning: read the source at the ref you are about to cite. A wrong pin is more misleading than a moving one, because it looks checked.

### Docstrings

Every public module, class, function, and method gets a docstring. Style is prose, not Sphinx.

- **One imperative summary line.** Single-line docstrings stay on one line and end with a period. Carve-out: a port `Protocol` class describes a seam, not an action, so its summary may lead with a role noun-phrase.
- **Prose body when more is needed.** Blank line after the summary, then narrative paragraphs. Use Markdown subheaders (`## Section`) for distinct concerns.
- **Domain vocabulary matches the [glossary](glossary.md).** A seam is a seam, not an interface. An adapter is an adapter, not a driver.
- **Cross-references**: backticks for in-module symbols; a dotted path for anything in another module.

#### A docstring may not name code or files that do not exist

Backticks mean "this is a symbol". A reader who cannot find a backticked
name has no way to tell a name they have missed from a name that is not
there, so every dangling reference costs a search that ends in nothing.

Two fitness tests in `test_docstring_references_resolve.py` enforce this. A
backticked name whose shape says it is code, meaning CamelCase, a
screaming-snake constant, a leading-underscore private name or a snake_case
name, must be bound somewhere in `src` or `tests`. A cited file path must
exist in this project.

The scan is scoped to this project rather than to whatever tree surrounds
it, and that is the half that earns its keep. A citation of a neighbouring
directory resolves for exactly as long as the neighbour is next door.

The tests admit three declared exceptions, each a named frozenset:

| | For | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `EXTERNAL_NAMES` | Real, defined outside this project | `Skipped`, one of the keeper's words for how a step ended |
| `PROSPECTIVE_NAMES` | Real nowhere, deliberately | a test name inside the rule that judges test names |
| `EXTERNAL_FILES` | A real file this project does not hold | `thinker.toml`, which an operator writes |

`PROSPECTIVE_NAMES` exists because naming a thing before it exists, or
after it stops existing, is a legitimate move: telling a future author what
to call something, standing in for a type inside a worked example, or
saying what a removal removed. Each entry still costs a line, so adding one
is a decision rather than a way past the check.

Neither test can see a wrong explanation of a real symbol. They catch the
cheaper failure, which is prose that refers to nothing at all. That is worth
having on the first day rather than the hundredth: this project's prose
names the keeper's vocabulary throughout, and a word that looks like one of
the keeper's names and is not is exactly the reference a reader cannot
resolve and cannot tell apart from one they have missed.

Use a word instead of a symbol when you mean a word: an `Adapter` suffix is
a string, not a class, and the backticks claim otherwise.

**Anti-patterns:**

- Do not use `Args:` / `Returns:` / `Raises:` sections. Type annotations are the parameter contract; raised exceptions belong in prose when non-obvious.
- Do not restate the type signature in prose.
- Do not write `>>>` doctest examples. The tests are external.
- Do not name a phase, iteration, or audit in a docstring. Those rot. The current code is what is true; ordering lives in git history. Name the precedent itself, not the phase that shipped it.

### Comments

Default to none. Well-named identifiers carry WHAT.

Add a `#` comment only when the WHY is non-obvious: a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific bug, behavior that would surprise a reader. State the constraint, not the history.

**Anti-patterns:**

- Do not narrate WHAT the next line does. The code says that.
- Do not annotate the current task, fix, or caller. Git log and the PR description are the right home.
- Do not leave dead-code markers (`# was`, `# previously`, `# old`). Delete the dead code.
- Do not leave `# TODO`, `# FIXME`, `# HACK` without an owner and a trigger. File an issue or drop it.
- Do not use `# noqa: <code>` without a trailing comment explaining the suppression.
- Do not draw section dividers. One concern per module already provides navigation.

### Tests

Test names carry scenarios. Per-test docstrings stay rare.

- **`test_<subject>_<scenario>_<expectation>`** is the naming convention. Long is fine.
- **Property-based tests document the property**, not the test shape. The `@given` body is the test; the docstring is the invariant being verified.
- **Architecture tests document the rule, the rationale, and the exception.** They are the structural guardrails; a future contributor needs to know why each rule exists.
- **Fixture docstrings only when non-obvious.** A canned transport, a scripted provider, and similar subtleties get one paragraph where they are defined. Simple fixtures stay bare.

## Commits

Conventional Commits with scope: `type(scope): subject`. Imperative, lowercase, no trailing period, under 72 characters.

| Type | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | New caller-visible capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Internal restructure, no behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance |
| `test` | Tests only |
| `docs` | Docs only |
| `build` | Build, deps, packaging |
| `ci` | CI, pre-commit, hooks |
| `chore` | Anything else not user-visible |

**Scopes:** `case`, `conclusions`, `think`, `seams`, `config`, and one per adapter (`keeper`). Repo-level ones are `repo`, `deps` and `ci`. Pick the dominant scope or omit it.

**Granularity:** one commit is one cohesive change that compiles and passes tests. Port, adapter, and test for one capability is one commit. Refactor plus feature is two.

The subject line says WHAT; the body says WHY.

## Branch flow

Solo: commit directly to `main`. CI must be green before pushing.

**For anything non-trivial, use a worktree.** `git worktree add ../thinker-<task> main`, work there, commit, and return. Two reasons:

- A parallel session's checkout can destroy uncommitted work in the main tree.
- Pre-commit stashes unstaged changes to tracked files but [never untracked ones](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/1212). A half-staged work-in-progress slice (untracked `handler.py` plus unstaged `wire.py` edits hidden by the stash) will false-fail architecture fitness functions and force `--no-verify` to land an otherwise-clean commit.

Also avoid `git commit -- <paths>` with mixed staged and unstaged state: the path form bypasses the index in a way pre-commit's stash flow does not expect. Stage everything and verify `git diff` is empty before committing.


## Test names
Descriptive-sentence pytest style: snake_case prefixed with `test_`.

```
test_<subject>_<expected_outcome>[_<scenario>]
```

- **subject**: the unit under test.
- **expected_outcome**: the property pinned, not the inputs.
- **scenario** (optional): conditions, introduced with `when_` or `for_`.

Optimize for the property, not the inputs.

**Good:**

```
test_decide_emits_thing_defined_when_stream_is_empty
test_handler_returns_thing_for_known_id
test_post_things_returns_201_with_thing_id
```

**Avoid:**

```
test_post_things_with_three_parts_in_order_b_a_c   # describes inputs
test_handler_3                                      # opaque
test_register_thing_works                           # outcome too vague
```
