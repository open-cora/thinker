"""A published project may not cite a spike.

A spike is a program written to settle one question and then abandoned.
Nothing re-runs it, nothing keeps it working, and the packages it drove move
underneath it, so a measurement one produced is a note from an afternoon
rather than a standing fact. The directory holding them also sits at the
root of the development tree, which reaches that checkout and none of the
repositories published from it, so a citation here points at something a
reader of this project cannot open.

The development tree's own pages may cite them freely. This rule is about
what ships.

## Why a word and not a path

The paths are already gone once. One commit deleted the spikes and rewrote
every citation in the tree from a path to the bare phrase "a spike", and
when the spikes came back three days later the restoration could not find
these: the path had been the handle. The citations that survived were
invisible to any search for the directory, and were found only by reading.
A word survives that, which is why this refuses one.

## What a claim becomes instead

The mechanism, stated as what holds rather than as what was once observed.
"SIGKILL offers no hook" needs no witness. "A spike measured that SIGKILL
offers no hook" cites one that does not ship. Where a sentence carried a
count, the count goes and the reason it mattered stays.

## What this does not reach

The enumerators below are the ones the sibling prose rules share, and they
cover tracked `.py` and `.md`. A citation in `pyproject.toml` or another
config file is not seen, and one was: widening the enumerator would change
what every rule sharing it scans, so the gap is recorded here rather than
closed from this file.
