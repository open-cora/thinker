"""Git's view of this project, for the checks that range over all of it.

Every check that enumerates files goes through here rather than walking
the filesystem, and the reason is pre-commit. It stashes unstaged changes
to tracked files and never untracked ones, so during a hook run a
half-written module sits live on disk beside stashed edits to the file
that was going to import it. A filesystem walk sees that arrangement and
fails on it; git's tracked set sees what pre-commit is actually
evaluating.

The corollary is the trap, and it is worth stating because a green run
looks the same either way: a file git has never seen is invisible to
every check below. Stage new files before trusting one.

Rooted at the project rather than at the checkout, because this project
is one directory inside a larger tree today and a repository of its own
afterwards. Scoping to the directory means these checks already range
over exactly what the repository will hold, so a citation that will break
at the split breaks here instead.
