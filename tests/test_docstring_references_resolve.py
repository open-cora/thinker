"""A docstring may not name code or files that do not exist.

Backticks mean "this is a symbol". A reader who cannot find a backticked
name has no way to tell a name they have missed from a name that is not
there, so every dangling reference costs a search that ends in nothing.

Two rules, both decidable:

  - A backticked name whose shape says it is code must be bound somewhere
    in `src` or `tests`, or be declared in one of the two sets below.
  - A file path cited in a docstring must exist in this project.

Neither can see a wrong explanation of a real symbol. They catch the
cheaper failure, which is prose that refers to nothing at all.

## Why this project has its own copy

The rule is stated on this project's conventions page, which said it was
enforced before anything enforced it. That is the defect the same page
warns about two sections earlier: a rule falsely believed to be enforced
is worse than no rule, because nobody looks twice at it.

The scan is scoped to this project rather than to the checkout around it,
which is what makes it worth having. Prose here cited a sibling directory
for a long time, and such a citation resolves for exactly as long as the
sibling is next door.
