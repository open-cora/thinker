"""A number written beside "outward seams" is one the module can produce.

The count at the head of `seams` is the first thing a reader of this
package meets, and it is repeated wherever something else describes the
family. Nothing read either side of that, so both sides drifted: adding
or removing a seam is a change to a module, and the prose about it is in
a different file that the same change has no reason to open.

Found by counting rather than by reading. Three such numbers were wrong
across this tree on one afternoon, one of them written an hour earlier
by the change that made it wrong.

The rule is narrow on purpose. It governs the exact phrase "N outward
seams" and nothing else, because the word seam appears in ordinary prose
beside ordinary numbers all through this package, and a check that tried
to judge those would be guessing. A new way of spelling the same claim
escapes this, which is why the occurrence count is pinned below: a
rewording that leaves the rule matching nothing fails rather than
passes.
