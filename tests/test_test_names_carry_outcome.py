"""Test function names state the property, not just the subject.

`test_<subject>_<scenario>_<expectation>`, and long is fine. A name that
stops at the subject tells a reader which code ran but not what was
supposed to be true of it, so a failure report names a function rather
than a broken promise.

The heuristic is deliberately loose: a minimum word count and a ban on
the vaguest endings. It catches `test_handler_works`, not every weak
name. A tighter rule would reject legitimate names and get suppressed,
which is worth less than a loose rule that holds.
