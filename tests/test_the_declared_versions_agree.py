"""The two places this project declares its version have to agree.

`pyproject.toml` is what a build reads and `CITATION.cff` is what a citation
reads, and nothing but this keeps them saying the same thing. A stale version
in the second does not break anything, which is the problem: it ends up in
somebody's bibliography, pointing at a release that was never cut.

The release tag is the third declaration and it is not checked here, because
it does not exist in the tree. The ordering that keeps all three in step is in
CONTRIBUTING.md: bump both files, publish, then tag what was published.

## Why this reads CITATION.cff by hand

It is YAML, and the obvious answer is a YAML parser. No project here declares
one: the library is present only as something pre-commit pulls in, so a test
importing it would depend on another tool's dependency tree. Declaring it
would mean adding a dependency to every project to read three strings, and
a strict typechecker then wants casts around everything the parser returns.

What is actually needed is three top-level scalars out of a file that is
machine-readable by construction. That is a line with no indentation, which
is a rule small enough to implement and, below, to show working.
