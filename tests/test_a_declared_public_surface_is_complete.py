"""A module that declares an `__all__` lists everything public it defines.

Declaring one is optional here and several modules declare none, which
says the module has no curated surface and is a position this leaves
alone. Declaring an incomplete one says something false: that the names
in it are the surface, when something public is missing from the list.

This is the set-shaped half of a failure that keeps happening. A new
class lands everywhere it appears on its own, in the definition, at the
call, in the tests, in the prose, and is dropped in the one place things
appear as a collection. Nothing breaks, because an import reaches past
`__all__` and a star-import is not how anything here loads anything.

Five modules across this tree were wrong when this was written, two of
them lost by commits from the same week as the classes they omitted.
Counting them took a few lines and finding them by reading had not
happened in months.

Private names are skipped, and so is anything imported rather than
defined, because re-exporting is a choice and this rule is about what a
module makes and then fails to mention.
